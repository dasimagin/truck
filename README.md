Truck is an open source project dedicated to the construction and development of the 2.5D indoor autonomous vehicle with [ackermann steering model](https://github.com/robotics-laboratory/truck/blob/master/doc/ackermann_vehicle.md). It's maintained by the Robotics Group (Faculty of Computer Science, HSE University) and enthusiasts. You may follow our progress on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF6cDalz8-I&list=PLR1nN_AQOO9zHpkW-phZnqVywjUCj7zHZ).

It is intended to be an educational reasearch project, so, to maintain a rich set of study materials and detailed [documentation](https://github.com/robotics-laboratory/truck/blob/master/doc/README.md) is among our goals.
